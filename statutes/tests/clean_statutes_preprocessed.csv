Each address shall be provided in standard postal format.  Such electronic database shall also provide the appropriate code for each street address with respect to political subdivisions which are not taxing jurisdictions when reasonably needed to determine the proper taxing jurisdictions.(b)  This section applies to state and local sales and use taxes administered and computed under this title or Title 3 and to which this title or Title 3 applies, including this chapter.(c)  The federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Sections 116-126) governs the sourcing of charges for mobile telecommunications services.  In accordance with that Act:(1)  mobile telecommunications services provided in a taxing jurisdiction to a customer, the charges for which are billed by or for the customer's home service provider, shall be deemed to be provided by the customer's home service provider;  and(2)  all charges for mobile telecommunications services that are deemed to be provided by the customer's home service provider in accordance with this Act are authorized to be subjected to tax, charge, or fee by the taxing jurisdictions whose territorial limits encompass the customer's place of primary use, regardless of where the mobile telecommunications services originate, terminate, or pass through, and no other taxing jurisdiction may impose taxes, charges, or fees on charges for such mobile telecommunications services.(d)  If a customer believes that an amount of tax or an assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction included on a billing is erroneous, the customer shall notify the home service provider in writing.  The customer shall include in the written notification:(1)  the customer's street address for the customer's place of primary use;(2)  the account name and number for which the customer requests the correction;(3)  a description of the error asserted by the customer;  and(4)  any other information that the home service provider reasonably requires to process the request.(e)  Not later than the 60th day after the date the home service provider receives a request under Subsection (d), the home service provider shall review the provider's records and the electronic database or enhanced zip code to determine the correct amount of the tax imposed or the assignment of the customer's place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction, as appropriate.  If the home service provider determines that the amount of tax imposed or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is incorrect, the home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit any amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer.  The home service provider shall correct the error and refund or credit the amount of tax erroneously collected from the customer for a period of up to four years.  If the home service provider determines that the amount of tax imposed or the assignment of place of primary use or taxing jurisdiction is correct, the home service provider shall provide a written explanation to the customer.(f)  The procedures prescribed by Subsections (d) and (e) are the first course of remedy available to a customer requesting a correction of assignment of place of primary use or of taxing jurisdiction or a refund of or other compensation for taxes erroneously collected by the home service provider.(g)  The state may provide an electronic database, described in Subsection (a)(3), to a home service provider or, if the state does not provide such an electronic database to home service providers, the designated database provider may provide an electronic database to a home service provider.(h)  The state or the designated database provider that provides or maintains an electronic database described in Subsection (a)(3) shall provide notice of the availability of the then current electronic database, and any subsequent revisions thereof, by publication in the manner normally employed by the state.(i)  A home service provider using the data contained in an electronic database described in Subsection (a)(3) shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability that otherwise would be due solely as a result of any error or omission in such database provided by the state or designated database provider.  The home service provider shall reflect changes made to such database during a calendar quarter not later than 30 days after the end of such calendar quarter.(j)  If neither the state nor the designated database provider provides an electronic database as described in Subsection (a)(3), a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax, charge, or fee liability in the state that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing jurisdiction if, subject to Subsection (n), the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction for each level of taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence at each level of taxing jurisdiction to ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction.  If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code for each level of taxing jurisdiction.  Any enhanced zip code assignment changed in accordance with Subsection (n) is deemed to be in compliance with this section.  For purposes of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised due diligence if such home service provider demonstrates that it has:(1)  expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;(2)  implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions;  and(3)  used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations, and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of such database.(k)  Subsection (j) applies to a home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements of Subsection (j), if an electronic database as defined in Subsection (a)(3) is not provided until the later of:(1)  18 months after the nationwide standard numeric code described in Subsection (a)(3) has been approved by the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Multistate Tax Commission;  or(2)  6 months after the state or a designated database provider in the state provides such database as prescribed in Subsection (a)(3).(l)  A home service provider shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining the customer's place of primary use as defined in Subsection (a)(2).  Subject to Subsection (n), and if the home service provider's reliance on information provided by its customer is in good faith, a taxing jurisdiction shall:(1)  allow a home service provider to rely on the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the home service provider's customer;  and(2)  not hold a home service provider liable for any additional taxes, charges, or fees based on a different determination of the place of primary use for taxes, charges, or fees that are customarily passed on to the customer as a separate itemized charge.(m)  Except as provided in Subsection (n), a taxing jurisdiction shall allow a home service provider to treat the address used by the home service provider for tax purposes for any customer under a service contract or agreement in effect two years after the date of the enactment of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. Sections 116-126) as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement, for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees on charges for mobile telecommunications services are remitted.(n)  The state may:(1)  determine that the address used for purposes of determining the taxing jurisdictions to which taxes, charges, or fees for mobile telecommunications services are remitted does not meet the definition of place of primary use under Subsection (a)(2) and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the place of primary use on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination.  Before the state gives such notice of determination, the customer shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable state administrative procedures that the address is the customer's place of primary use;  and(2)  determine that the assignment of a taxing jurisdiction by a home service provider under Subsection (j) does not reflect the correct taxing jurisdiction and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the assignment on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination.  The home service provider shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable state administrative procedures that the assignment reflects the correct taxing jurisdiction.(o)(1) If a taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation and if these charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from charges that are subject to taxation, then the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services may be subject to taxation unless the home service provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to such tax, charge, or fee from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business.(2)  If a taxing jurisdiction does not subject charges for mobile telecommunications services to taxation, a customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for mobile telecommunications services unless the customer's home service provider separately states the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services from taxable charges or the home service provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the home service provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identifies the nontaxable charges.

A person whose registration number the comptroller proposes to revoke under this section is entitled to 20 days' written notice of the time and place of the hearing on the revocation.  The notice must state the reason the comptroller is seeking to revoke the person's registration number.  At the hearing the person must show cause why the person's registration number should not be revoked.(i)  The comptroller shall give written notice of the revocation of a registration number under Subsection (h) to the person to whom the number was issued.  The notice may be personally served on the person or sent by mail to the person's address as shown in the comptroller's records.(j)  If the comptroller revokes a person's registration number under Subsection (h), the comptroller may not revive the registration number unless the comptroller is satisfied that the person will comply with this chapter and the rules adopted under this chapter.

The failure of a person to notify a seller as required by this subsection is considered a failure and refusal to pay the taxes imposed by this chapter by the person required to make the notification.(l)  The comptroller shall develop and operate an online system to enable a seller of an item described by Subsection (a) to search and verify the validity of the registration number stated on an exemption certificate.  A seller is not required to use the online system.(m)  An exemption certificate that states a registration number issued by the comptroller to claim an exemption to which this section applies is sufficient documentation of the seller's receipt of the certificate in good faith for purposes of Sections 151.054 and 151.104.(n)  The comptroller by rule shall establish procedures by which a seller may accept a blanket exemption certificate with a registration number issued by the comptroller to claim exemptions to which this section applies.(o)  A use of an item purchased using an exemption certificate with a registration number issued under this section in a manner or for a purpose other than the manner or purpose that qualified the sale, lease, rental, or other consumption of the item for the exemption may result in the revocation of the number.(p)  A person eligible for a registration number who, at the time of purchasing, leasing, renting, or otherwise consuming an item for which the person may otherwise claim an exemption to which this section applies, has not obtained a registration number from the comptroller must pay the tax on the item to the seller at the time of the transaction.  The person may then apply for a registration number and, on receipt of the number, may apply to the comptroller for a refund of the tax paid, subject to the statute of limitations.  The comptroller by rule shall establish procedures for processing the refund requests.  Tax collected by a seller under this subsection is not tax collected in error, and Section 111.104 does not apply to a refund request submitted under this subsection.

The comptroller may require a maquiladora enterprise to post a bond or other security in the amount the comptroller considers reasonable to ensure the payment of state and local sales and use taxes.

The comptroller shall require a customs broker or authorized employee to use the website to actually produce the documentation after providing all necessary information.  The comptroller shall use the information provided by a customs broker or authorized employee under this subsection as necessary to enforce this section and Section 151.307.  The comptroller may provide an alternate method to prepare documentation to show the exemption of tangible personal property under Section 151.307(b)(2) in those instances when the password-protected website is unavailable due to technical or communication problems.  A customs broker or authorized employee may use the alternate method only if the comptroller provides prior authorization for each use.(b)  The comptroller may issue a license to a customs broker for the purpose described by Subsection (a) for each place of business of the broker if the broker:(1)  applies to the comptroller for the license;(2)  pays the license fee to the comptroller in the amount required by Subsection (c);(3)  posts the bond or security in the amount required by Subsection (d);  and(4)  complies with any rules of the comptroller to administer this section and to prevent the evasion of the tax under this chapter and local sales and use taxes.(c)  A customs broker must pay to the comptroller an annual license fee of $300 for each place of business from which the customs broker intends to issue a certificate of export. The comptroller shall use the fees only for the administration of this section, including costs of materials, labor, and overhead.(d)  The amount of the bond or security required by Subsection (b)(3) is $5,000, plus an additional $1,000 for each place of business from which the customs broker intends to issue exemption certificates.

The customs broker shall make available to the comptroller, without notice from the comptroller, the customs broker's books and records if the comptroller determines that the comptroller's ability to administer and enforce effectively the provisions of this chapter relating to documentation for the purpose of showing the exemption of tangible personal property under Section 151.307(b)(2) is jeopardized by providing notice.  The customs broker shall keep the books and records described by this subsection for at least two years after the date of the last entry that they contain.  The customs broker shall report quarterly to the comptroller:(1)  the total value of the tangible personal property and the total amount of the corresponding tax for which the customs broker issued certificates of export;  and(2)  the total amount of tax refunded in accordance with certificates of export.(f)  The comptroller may suspend or revoke a license issued under this section if the customs broker does not comply with  Section 151.1575(c) or issues documentation that is false. The comptroller may determine the length of suspension or revocation necessary for the enforcement of this chapter and the comptroller's rules.  A proceeding to suspend or revoke a license under this subsection is a contested case under Chapter 2001, Government Code.  Judicial review is by trial de novo.  The district courts of Travis County have exclusive original jurisdiction of a suit under this section.(f-1)  In addition to any other penalty provided by law, the comptroller may require a customs broker to pay to the comptroller the amount of any tax refunded and the amount of any penalty imposed under Section 151.1575(c) if the customs broker did not comply with this section or the rules adopted by the comptroller under this section.(g)  A customs broker may authorize a person to act as an independent contractor to certify in accordance with Section 151.1575(a)(1) that tangible personal property has been exported outside of the United States only if the authorization is part of the written contract and the comptroller in writing approves the authorization.  A customs broker may not authorize a person under this subsection to prepare documentation for the purpose of showing the exemption for tangible personal property under Section 151.307(b)(2).

The authorized percentage must be used for a three-year period specified by the comptroller, unless the authorization is revoked by the comptroller.(c)  The comptroller may revoke the authorization to report under this section if the comptroller determines that the percentage being used is no longer representative because of a change:(1)  in law, including a change in the interpretation of a law or rule;  or(2)  in the taxpayer's business operations.(d)  The decision of the comptroller to deny or revoke authorization under this section is not appealable.(e)  In deciding whether to authorize reporting under this section, the comptroller may categorize transactions by dollar amount, by type of taxable item purchased, by the purpose for which the taxable item will be used, or by other standards appropriate to the taxpayer's operations.(f)  The comptroller by rule may specify additional procedures that must be followed and conditions that must be met before the comptroller authorizes a taxpayer to report under this section.

188|151|420.0|  REVOCATION OF DIRECT PAYMENT PERMIT|  (a)  A person to whom a direct payment permit has been issued holds the permit as a matter of revocable privilege and not as a matter of right.

If there is a tax liability owed by the taxpayer in excess of the prepayment credit, the taxpayer shall send to the comptroller the remaining tax liability at the time of filing the quarterly or monthly report.  The taxpayer is entitled to the deduction permitted under Section 151.423 of this code on the amount of the remaining tax liability.(d)  If the amount of a prepayment exceeds the actual tax liability, the excess of the prepayment shall be credited against future tax liability of the taxpayer or refunded to the taxpayer as provided by Subchapter C of Chapter 111 of this code.
